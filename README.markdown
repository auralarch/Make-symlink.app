Make-symlink.app: an OSX GUI symlink droplet
============================================

An OS X GUI symbolic link (symlink, unix alias) maker. Drag and drop files or
directories onto this app, then nominate a destination directory to create a
symlink.

Installation
------------

Copy Make-symlink.app somewhere sensible (perhaps Library/Scripts in your home
folder). From that folder in Finder.app, drag it into your finder toolbar.

Usage
-----

Drag the file or directory you want to symlink to (the target) onto the app
icon. Change the source filename if you want the target filename to be
different to the source. Select the target directory.
